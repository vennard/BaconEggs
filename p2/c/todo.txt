batch mode

Hi John,
I'm going to convert my input system to the batch mode and then each feature has been "implemented," but not well tested.
I'm going to take care of that during my next class hopefully. I can't get the tests to run. I copied them into this directory
too, so if you can try running them, that'd be sweet.

Thanks!
Zach
